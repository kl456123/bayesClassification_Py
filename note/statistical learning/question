1.relationship of expected loss and empirical loss
why can get the best function by using mini the empirical loss


2.why can not use discriminative approach when there are lanten values


3.what is the function of precision and recall

notate:
P = TP/(TP + FP)

R = TP/(TP + FN)

4.why perceptron use margin function ignoring the 1/||w||

5.the dual problem of perceptron

6.approximation error and estimation error of KNN when concerning about the value of k

7. kd tree, how to get the nearest node

8.maximum likelihood estimation and empirical risk minimization

9.strucral risk minimization and maximum posterior probability estimation

10.prune in CART

11.GLM and logistic distribution
